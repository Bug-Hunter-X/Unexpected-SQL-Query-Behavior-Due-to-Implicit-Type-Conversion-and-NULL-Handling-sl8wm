This repository demonstrates a common SQL query error that might arise from implicit type conversion, data type mismatch, and issues with handling NULL values.  The query aims to filter employees based on department ID and salary.  However, the code lacks explicit type handling and proper NULL checks, potentially resulting in inaccurate results or unexpected query failures.  The solution provides improvements in type handling and NULL handling for a more robust and accurate query.
